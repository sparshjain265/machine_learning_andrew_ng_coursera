\chapter{Introduction}
\emph{Machine learning} (task, experience, performance) can be classified into
\emph{Supervised} and \emph{Unsupervised} learning.

\section{Supervised Learning}
Supervised learning can be basically classified into \emph{Regression} and
\emph{Classification} problems.

\subsection{Regression Problem}
Regression problems work loosely on continuous range of outputs.

\subsection{Classification Problems}
Classification problems work loosely on discrete range of outputs.

\section{Unsupervised Learning}
An example is \emph{Clustering Problem}.
