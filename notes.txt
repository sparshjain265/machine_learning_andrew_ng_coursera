Machine Learning can be classified into Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
    Supervised Learning can be basically classified into Regression and Classification Problems.
        Regression problem works loosely on continuous range of outputs.
        Classification problem works on a discrete range of outputs.
    Unsupervised Learning
        An example is clustering problem.
